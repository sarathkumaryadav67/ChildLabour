    <h3>Objective of the Activity Done:</h3>
    <p>Survey on the range of awareness for children on child labour.</p>
    <h3>Detailed Report:</h3>
    <p><strong>On day 1:</strong> Went to Sachivalayam. Selected an area near my place of living and went to Sachivalayam for conducting this Community Service Project.</p>
    <p><strong>On day 2:</strong> Continued the survey. Focused on the following as part of the survey:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Questioned people about how many children are going to schools.</li>
        <li>Questioned people about how many children are working as labour in fields.</li>
        <li>Gathered information about the children in our locality.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>On day 3:</strong> Based on the survey and gathered information, found that some children are not attending schools and many people are unaware of government schemes for children. Observed lack of awareness about the impacts of child labour.</p>
    <p><strong>On day 4:</strong> Based on the survey outcome and analysis, planned an awareness program in the area.</p>
